GitHub Repository Structure Overview

The Luci Digital platform uses a well-organized GitHub repository structure to manage the development, deployment, and ongoing maintenance of the project. This structure ensures clear version control, organized collaboration, and streamlined deployment processes across all components of the system. This README outlines the repository structure, including branches, folders, and best practices for contributing to the repository.

Key Components:

    Main Repository: Houses the core codebase and essential resources.
    Branching Strategy: A systematic approach for managing development, testing, and production code.
    Folder Structure: Organizes the files and assets within the repository for easy navigation and management.
    Commit Guidelines and Naming Conventions: Standardizes how code contributions should be made.
    Pull Request and Review Process: Ensures quality control and collaboration on new contributions.

Repository Name: luci-digital

    Main Repository URL: https://github.com/luci-digital/luci-digital

    Repository Sections:
        docs/: Documentation related to the platform, including README files, executive summaries, guides, and technical specifications.
        scripts/: Deployment and automation scripts (e.g., Terraform, Vagrant, Docker) for spinning up virtual machines and containers.
        services/: Code and configurations for various platform services, such as ManageEngine, MDM, Lucia AI, and IoT integrations.
        configs/: Configuration files for security protocols, networking setups, container orchestration, and service deployments.
        api/: API endpoints and definitions for managing interactions between the various components of the platform (e.g., client portal, AI workflows, service desk).
        tests/: Unit tests and integration tests to ensure platform stability and reliability across deployments.

Branching Strategy

Luci Digital follows a GitFlow branching model for structured development and release management:

    Main Branches:
        main: The default branch for production-ready code. Only stable releases are merged into this branch.
        develop: The primary development branch where new features, bug fixes, and updates are integrated before final testing.

    Feature Branches:
        feature/{feature-name}: Dedicated branches for individual features or modules under active development. Once completed, feature branches are merged into develop.

    Release Branches:
        release/{version-number}: Created when a new version of the platform is ready for final testing and pre-release. Once tested and approved, the code is merged into main and tagged with the release version.

    Hotfix Branches:
        hotfix/{issue-name}: Used for urgent fixes that must be applied to the main branch. Once resolved, hotfix branches are merged into both main and develop.

Commit Guidelines and Naming Conventions

    Commit Message Guidelines:
        Format: Use a consistent format for commit messages:
            fix: for bug fixes
            feat: for new features
            chore: for minor updates (e.g., dependencies)
            docs: for documentation updates
            test: for test updates

    Example:

    vbnet

    feat: Add new AR feature for client onboarding
    fix: Resolve API authentication issue
    docs: Update communication and client management README

    Branch Naming Conventions:
        Feature Branches: feature/{feature-name}
        Hotfix Branches: hotfix/{issue-name}
        Release Branches: release/{version-number}

Pull Request and Review Process

    Pull Request Guidelines:
        All changes must be submitted via Pull Requests (PRs). Each PR should clearly state the purpose of the changes, the affected areas, and any relevant issue or feature ticket numbers.
        PR Title Format: Use the same conventions as commit messages (e.g., feat: Add new AR feature).
        Description: Provide a clear and concise description of what the PR changes, including the context, any dependencies, and testing notes.

    Code Review Process:
        PRs are reviewed by the team before being merged into develop or main.
        Automated tests are run during the review process to ensure stability.
        Reviewers provide feedback, and changes are requested if necessary before approval and merge.

Continuous Integration and Deployment

    CI/CD Pipelines:
        The repository is integrated with CI/CD pipelines that automatically run tests, security checks, and deployment scripts when code is pushed to the repository.
        GitHub Actions: Used for automating workflows such as testing, linting, and deploying services to staging or production environments.

    Automated Testing:
        All new code must pass unit and integration tests before it can be merged into main.
        Test results are logged in the CI pipeline and reviewed as part of the pull request process.

Best Practices

    Regular Pull Requests: Developers should submit small, frequent pull requests rather than large, infrequent ones. This makes it easier to review and merge changes.
    Code Reviews: All code must be reviewed by at least one other team member before merging into develop or main. Peer reviews help maintain code quality and catch potential issues early.
    Documentation: Ensure that all new features or significant changes are documented in the relevant docs/ files. Keeping documentation updated is critical for smooth development and deployment.
