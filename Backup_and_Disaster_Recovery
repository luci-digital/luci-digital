Luci Digital - Backup and Disaster Recovery

Overview

Luci Digital’s Backup and Disaster Recovery protocols ensure that all client data and system configurations are securely backed up and recoverable in the event of hardware failure, data corruption, or other disruptions. The platform uses automated, encrypted backups and robust disaster recovery strategies to protect against data loss and minimize downtime. These protocols are managed primarily by the Data node, which handles backup scheduling, encryption, and restoration procedures.

This document provides an overview of the backup and disaster recovery processes, the tools used, and the protocols in place to ensure continuous service delivery and data integrity.

Core Components

1. Data Node

	•	Role: The Data node is responsible for storing and managing all backup data for the Luci Digital platform. It performs automated backups, ensures data encryption, and handles disaster recovery operations to restore services in case of a failure.
	•	Core Functions:
	•	Automated Backups: Data performs scheduled backups of critical client data, system configurations, and AI models.
	•	Disaster Recovery Protocols: In the event of a system failure, the Data node executes recovery procedures to restore services and minimize downtime.
	•	Encryption: All backups are encrypted to protect sensitive data from unauthorized access.

2. Proxmox Backup Server

	•	Role: Proxmox Backup Server is the tool used to manage backup operations, providing automated scheduling, encryption, and recovery capabilities. It ensures that backups are stored securely and can be restored quickly in case of data loss or failure.
	•	Core Functions:
	•	Backup Scheduling: Proxmox Backup Server automates the creation of backups at regular intervals, ensuring that data is always up-to-date.
	•	Deduplication: Data deduplication reduces storage requirements by identifying and eliminating duplicate data across backups.
	•	Encryption: All backups are encrypted with strong algorithms (e.g., AES-256) to prevent unauthorized access to sensitive data.
	•	Disaster Recovery: Proxmox provides tools for efficient data restoration, ensuring minimal disruption to services.

Backup Processes

1. Backup Types

	•	Full Backups: Periodic full backups are performed on the entire platform, including client data, system configurations, AI models, and other critical information. These backups are stored both locally and in the cloud to ensure redundancy.
	•	Incremental Backups: Incremental backups capture only the changes made since the last full backup, minimizing storage requirements and speeding up the backup process. Incremental backups are typically performed more frequently to ensure up-to-date data.
	•	Configuration Backups: Configuration files for the Luci Digital platform are backed up separately to ensure that system settings and AI workflows can be restored quickly if needed.

2. Backup Schedules

	•	Daily Incremental Backups: Incremental backups are scheduled daily to capture any changes to client data, device configurations, and system operations.
	•	Weekly Full Backups: Full backups are performed weekly to create comprehensive snapshots of the entire system, including all client data, service logs, AI models, and configurations.
	•	Monthly Archival Backups: Monthly archival backups are stored for long-term retention, ensuring that historical data is available if needed for compliance, auditing, or recovery purposes.

3. Backup Storage Locations

	•	Local Storage: Backups are initially stored locally on the Data node for quick access and recovery.
	•	Cloud Storage: Redundant copies of backups are stored in a secure cloud environment to ensure that data is available in the event of a local system failure.
	•	Encryption: All backups, whether local or cloud-based, are encrypted to prevent unauthorized access. Encryption keys are securely managed using Vault.

Disaster Recovery Protocols

1. Failover and Recovery Procedures

	•	Failover Protocols: In the event of a failure on the Nebula, Tron, or Data nodes, Luci Digital’s failover protocols automatically redirect traffic and services to redundant systems. This minimizes downtime and ensures that clients can continue accessing services.
	•	Data Restoration: Backups stored on the Data node and in the cloud are used to restore services quickly. The restoration process includes decrypting and loading backup data, ensuring that all client data, AI models, and system configurations are restored to their most recent state.
	•	Testing and Validation: Once recovery is complete, the system is thoroughly tested to validate the integrity of the restored data and configurations. This ensures that services are fully operational before being made available to clients.

2. Recovery Time Objective (RTO) and Recovery Point Objective (RPO)

	•	Recovery Time Objective (RTO): Luci Digital’s goal is to restore services as quickly as possible following a failure. The RTO is typically set at less than 1 hour, depending on the scope of the failure.
	•	Recovery Point Objective (RPO): The RPO defines the acceptable amount of data loss in the event of a failure. Luci Digital’s RPO is minimal, with daily incremental backups ensuring that data loss is limited to 24 hours at most.

3. Redundancy and High Availability

	•	Redundant Systems: The platform employs redundant systems to ensure high availability. In case of hardware failure, traffic is automatically redirected to backup systems until the issue is resolved.
	•	High Availability: Luci Digital’s infrastructure is designed for high availability, ensuring that services remain accessible to clients even during maintenance or partial outages.

Data Security

1. Backup Encryption

	•	Encryption at Rest: All backups are encrypted using AES-256 or a similar encryption standard to protect data from unauthorized access while stored on the Data node or in the cloud.
	•	Encryption in Transit: Data transmitted between the Data node and cloud storage is encrypted using SSL/TLS to ensure that it remains secure during transfer.
	•	Vault Integration: Encryption keys are managed securely through Vault, ensuring that only authorized services and administrators can access the backup data.

2. Access Control and Authorization

	•	Role-Based Access Control (RBAC): Access to backup data is strictly controlled through role-based access policies. Only authorized personnel can initiate backups, access stored data, or perform recovery operations.
	•	Audit Logs: All backup and recovery operations are logged and monitored, ensuring that any unauthorized access attempts or anomalies are detected and addressed promptly.

3. Compliance and Data Retention

	•	Regulatory Compliance: Luci Digital adheres to industry standards and regulatory requirements for data protection and retention, ensuring that client data is handled securely and in compliance with applicable laws.
	•	Retention Policies: Data retention policies are enforced to ensure that backup data is retained for the required period, after which it is securely deleted or archived based on client or regulatory needs.

Testing and Validation

1. Regular Backup Testing

	•	Backup Testing: Luci Digital regularly tests its backup processes to ensure that data can be restored quickly and without errors. These tests include verifying the integrity of backup files and ensuring that all encryption keys are functioning correctly.
	•	Simulation of Disaster Scenarios: The platform simulates disaster scenarios to test recovery procedures. These tests ensure that the system can recover from a variety of failure scenarios, such as hardware malfunctions, data corruption, or security breaches.

2. Periodic Review

	•	Backup and Recovery Audits: Periodic audits are conducted to review the effectiveness of the backup and disaster recovery processes. These audits ensure that the system is prepared for any eventuality and that recovery objectives are met.

Conclusion

Luci Digital’s Backup and Disaster Recovery protocols provide a secure and reliable solution for protecting client data and ensuring continuous service delivery. Through automated backups, encrypted storage, and robust disaster recovery procedures, the platform minimizes the risk of data loss and ensures that services can be restored quickly in the event of a failure. Regular testing and audits ensure that the system remains resilient and capable of handling disruptions.
