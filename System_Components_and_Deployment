Luci Digital - System Components and Deployment

The Luci Digital platform is built on a robust architecture combining smart boxes, NAS systems, AI, IoT devices, and secure communications. The system’s deployment is designed for scalability, privacy, and real-time responsiveness. Below are the details of the core components and the deployment structure.

1. Smart Boxes and Edge Computing

Overview:

Luci Digital’s Smart Boxes serve as localized hubs for managing IoT devices, AI processing, and communication services. These boxes operate on edge computing principles, ensuring real-time data analysis and decision-making.

Key Features:

	•	Edge AI Processing: AI agents run directly on the smart boxes, allowing for fast response times and reduced latency for local tasks.
	•	IoT Integration: Smart Boxes manage connected IoT devices (e.g., sensors, cameras) using LoRaWAN and local communication protocols.
	•	Network Interface: Each smart box is connected to the local network via Ethernet or Wi-Fi, ensuring continuous communication with other devices and centralized management systems.

2. Synology NAS for Private Cloud Infrastructure

Overview:

The Synology NAS systems provide a private cloud environment for storing data, managing backups, and deploying Docker containers for various services. The NAS also acts as a central point for managing IoT devices and AI processing.

Key Features:

	•	Docker Integration: Synology NAS systems host Docker containers, allowing for flexible deployment of services like AI modules, network monitoring tools, and backup management.
	•	Private Cloud Storage: Synology’s DSM (DiskStation Manager) allows for secure, scalable storage for both client data and system services.
	•	Backup and Disaster Recovery: The NAS ensures data is backed up locally, with encryption for data at rest and in transit. It integrates with cloud solutions such as Proxmox Backup Server for additional security and redundancy.

3. HiLuciNet Gateway and IoT Network

Overview:

HiLuciNet is Luci Digital’s private IoT network, built on LoRaWAN technology and integrated with The Things Network. HiLuciNet supports a wide range of IoT applications, including environmental monitoring, security systems, and device tracking.

Key Features:

	•	LoRaWAN Integration: HiLuciNet provides long-range, low-power connectivity for IoT devices. It supports applications such as soil moisture monitoring, pet tracking, and air quality measurement.
	•	Scalable Deployment: The gateway can be expanded across Alberta, allowing for a wide coverage area and high device density.
	•	Data Processing and Routing: IoT data is processed locally on smart boxes, then securely transmitted to the NAS for further analysis and storage.

Key Features:

	•	Local AI Agents: AI runs locally on smart boxes to provide real-time assistance and automation for connected devices.
	•	Automation of Network Tasks: AI manages tasks such as device onboarding, network traffic monitoring, and alert handling.
	•	Client Interaction: AI is responsible for responding to client requests, managing device issues, and providing recommendations for system improvements.

5. Security Protocols and Zero-Trust Architecture

Overview:

Security is at the core of the Luci Digital platform, which implements a zero-trust architecture to ensure that only authorized devices and users can access the system.

Key Features:

	•	Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA): Biometric security (Face ID, Touch ID) and security keys ensure that user access is secure and verifiable.
	•	Decentralized Identity: Luci Digital uses blockchain technology to manage identities, ensuring that no single point of failure can compromise the system.
	•	End-to-End Encryption: All data is encrypted during transmission and at rest, protecting against unauthorized access and data breaches.

6. Augmented Reality (AR) Features

Overview:

Luci Digital incorporates augmented reality (AR) to help users visualize network connections, packet flows, and IoT device interactions in real time. This feature enhances user engagement and provides intuitive ways to manage and troubleshoot network issues.

Key Features:

	•	AR Network Visualization: Users can scan their network using their smartphone to view active connections, packet flows, and device relationships.
	•	AR-Triggered Interactions: AR watermarks on physical documents or devices trigger interactive experiences, allowing users to engage with the Luci Digital platform in new and innovative ways.
