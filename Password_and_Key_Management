Luci Digital - Password and Key Management

Luci Digital prioritizes security through a comprehensive password and key management system. By integrating Synology C2 Password and leveraging decentralized security practices, Luci Digital ensures that users have complete control over their authentication data while maintaining a high level of security across devices and networks. The system is designed to simplify password management, facilitate multi-factor authentication, and ensure encrypted storage of sensitive credentials.

1. Centralized Password Management with Synology C2

Overview:

Luci Digital uses Synology C2 Password as the central platform for managing passwords and security keys. This system allows clients to securely store, retrieve, and manage their passwords across all their devices, while also enabling role-based access controls for families and businesses.

Key Features:

	•	Centralized Storage: All passwords and security keys are stored securely within Synology C2 Password, which uses end-to-end encryption to protect sensitive data.
	•	Cross-Device Synchronization: Clients can synchronize their passwords and security credentials across all devices connected to Luci Digital, ensuring easy and secure access wherever they are.
	•	Role-Based Access: Users can assign different levels of access to family members or employees, ensuring that only authorized individuals have access to specific systems or information.

2. Encryption and Security

Overview:

Luci Digital ensures that all passwords, security keys, and sensitive information are encrypted both in transit and at rest. This protects users’ credentials from unauthorized access and ensures compliance with security best practices.

Key Features:

	•	End-to-End Encryption: All data stored in Synology C2 Password is encrypted with AES-256, ensuring that even in the event of a breach, the data remains secure.
	•	Zero-Knowledge Architecture: Synology C2 employs a zero-knowledge security model, meaning that Luci Digital and Synology cannot access the contents of clients’ password vaults—only the authorized users can decrypt the data.
	•	Encrypted Backups: Passwords and security keys are also backed up regularly in encrypted form, ensuring that credentials can be recovered even in the event of a disaster or data loss.

3. Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)

Overview:

Luci Digital enforces multi-factor authentication (MFA) across its platform to add an extra layer of security. Clients are required to authenticate using multiple factors, such as biometric security, hardware keys, or time-based one-time passwords (TOTP), ensuring that only authorized users can access sensitive data.

Key Features:

	•	Biometric Authentication: Devices with biometric capabilities, such as Face ID and Touch ID, are used as one of the factors for authenticating users. This adds convenience while enhancing security.
	•	Security Keys: Luci Digital supports hardware security keys, such as YubiKeys, for MFA. These keys provide an additional layer of protection against phishing and other online attacks.
	•	TOTP Authentication: Clients can use time-based one-time passwords generated by authentication apps like Google Authenticator or Authy to log into their accounts securely.

4. Hierarchical Key Management

Overview:

Luci Digital employs a hierarchical key management system that allows families and businesses to organize access to their devices, services, and systems based on predefined roles and permissions.

Key Features:

	•	Role-Based Permissions: Administrators can assign roles and set permissions based on the needs of their family members or employees. For example, parents can control access to certain devices or accounts for their children, while business owners can assign specific access to employees based on their roles.
	•	Delegated Access: In cases where temporary access is needed (e.g., contractors or guest users), administrators can assign limited-time permissions to ensure secure access without compromising the overall system.
	•	Audit Trails: All actions related to password access and key management are logged for auditing purposes. This allows administrators to review any changes or access attempts, ensuring accountability within the system.

5. Key and Certificate Management

Overview:

In addition to password management, Luci Digital provides key and certificate management for securing devices, networks, and communications. This includes managing SSL certificates, API keys, and other encryption credentials.

Key Features:

	•	SSL/TLS Certificates: Luci Digital ensures that all network communications are protected by SSL/TLS certificates, which are automatically renewed through services like Let’s Encrypt.
	•	API Key Management: API keys used for external integrations or IoT devices are securely stored and managed within Synology C2 Password, ensuring that they remain protected.
	•	Device Authentication: Each device connected to the Luci Digital platform is authenticated using unique certificates and keys, ensuring that only authorized devices can access the network.

6. Password Recovery and Emergency Access

Overview:

Luci Digital offers robust password recovery and emergency access features to ensure that users can regain control of their accounts in the event of a lost password or emergency situation.

Key Features:

	•	Password Recovery Options: Clients can securely recover their passwords using pre-configured recovery methods, such as biometric authentication, recovery codes, or trusted contacts.
	•	Emergency Access: In the event of an emergency, designated individuals (e.g., family members or business partners) can be granted access to certain accounts or devices. This feature is particularly useful for managing critical information in the case of incapacitation or emergencies.
	•	Secure Password Reset: All password resets require multi-factor authentication to ensure that the process is secure and only authorized individuals can reset the password.

7. Client and User Education
