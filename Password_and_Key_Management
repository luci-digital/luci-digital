Luci Digital - Password and Key Management

Overview

Luci Digital’s Password and Key Management strategy is designed to ensure the secure handling, storage, and rotation of sensitive credentials such as passwords, encryption keys, API tokens, and other secrets. Central to this strategy is the use of Vault for securely managing and distributing these secrets across the platform’s components, including Nebula, Tron, and Data nodes. This document outlines the processes for managing passwords, encryption keys, and other sensitive data within the Luci Digital platform.

Core Components

1. Vault (Secret Management)

	•	Role: Vault by HashiCorp is used to manage, store, and securely distribute secrets such as passwords, API tokens, and encryption keys. It provides centralized secret storage, dynamic secret generation, and automatic key rotation to enhance security across the platform.
	•	Core Functions:
	•	Secure Storage: Vault stores all passwords, encryption keys, and sensitive credentials in an encrypted format, ensuring they are protected from unauthorized access.
	•	Dynamic Secrets: Vault can generate dynamic secrets (e.g., database credentials) that are automatically revoked after a specified period, reducing the risk of compromise.
	•	Automatic Key Rotation: Vault automatically rotates encryption keys and other sensitive credentials on a regular schedule, ensuring that secrets remain secure even in the event of a data breach.

2. Password Management for Clients

	•	Role: Luci Digital provides a secure password management solution for clients, allowing them to manage their passwords, credentials, and secrets across IoT devices, smart systems, and user accounts.
	•	Core Functions:
	•	Master Password: Clients can configure a master password that secures access to all devices and services within the Luci Digital ecosystem. The master password is stored securely in Vault.
	•	Role-Based Access Control: Access to passwords and credentials can be limited based on the role of the user, ensuring that only authorized personnel have access to specific resources.
	•	Two-Factor Authentication (2FA): 2FA is enforced for accessing password vaults and other sensitive areas, providing an additional layer of security.

3. Encryption Key Management

	•	Role: Encryption keys are used to secure data at rest and in transit within the Luci Digital platform. These keys are securely managed by Vault and are subject to regular rotation and auditing.
	•	Core Functions:
	•	Key Generation and Rotation: Encryption keys are generated and rotated automatically by Vault to ensure that all sensitive data remains secure over time. This includes encryption keys used for SSL/TLS certificates, encrypted backups, and encrypted communication between nodes.
	•	Key Revocation: If a key is compromised, Vault allows for immediate revocation and re-issuance of new keys to prevent unauthorized access to encrypted data.
	•	Audit Logging: All key management operations, including generation, rotation, and revocation, are logged and monitored for auditing purposes.

Password and Key Management Processes

1. Secure Password Storage

	•	Client Password Vault: Each client has access to a password vault where they can store and manage their passwords for connected devices, user accounts, and services. The vault is encrypted and securely managed by Vault.
	•	Device Authentication: When clients connect new devices to the Luci Digital platform, passwords and credentials are securely transmitted to Vault, where they are stored and managed for future use.
	•	Role-Based Password Access: Clients can configure role-based access controls to limit who within their organization or household can access certain passwords or perform specific actions, such as managing security settings or accessing certain devices.

2. Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)

	•	Mandatory 2FA: All users accessing the Luci Digital platform must enable 2FA for their accounts. This ensures that even if a password is compromised, unauthorized access is prevented.
	•	Biometric Authentication: In addition to traditional 2FA (e.g., SMS codes or authentication apps), Luci Digital supports biometric authentication (e.g., Face ID, Touch ID) for added security when accessing the password vault or managing sensitive credentials.

3. Automatic Key Rotation

	•	Encryption Key Rotation: Vault automatically rotates encryption keys used for data protection on a regular schedule. This reduces the risk of long-term key exposure and ensures that sensitive data remains protected even in the event of a key compromise.
	•	Certificate Rotation: SSL/TLS certificates used for secure communication between nodes are also rotated automatically by Vault. This ensures that secure communication channels remain protected and up to date.
	•	Database Credential Rotation: Database credentials used for accessing critical infrastructure components (such as the Data node) are dynamically generated and rotated by Vault, ensuring that access is time-limited and credentials are not reused indefinitely.

4. Secrets Revocation

	•	On-Demand Revocation: Vault allows administrators to revoke any secret or credential at any time, ensuring that compromised credentials can be quickly invalidated and replaced.
	•	Revocation Policies: Luci Digital implements strict revocation policies that ensure any expired or compromised secrets are automatically revoked, limiting the window of exposure in the event of a breach.

Security Protocols for Password and Key Management

1. End-to-End Encryption

	•	Encryption at Rest and In Transit: All passwords, credentials, and encryption keys managed by Vault are encrypted both at rest and in transit. This ensures that sensitive data remains secure even if the underlying storage or communication channels are compromised.
	•	AES-256 Encryption: Luci Digital uses AES-256 encryption to protect passwords and encryption keys stored within Vault, providing industry-standard protection against unauthorized access.

2. Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)

	•	Restricted Access to Vault: Access to Vault is restricted based on roles within the Luci Digital platform. Only authorized users and services can access specific secrets, and permissions are enforced through role-based policies.
	•	Granular Access Control: Vault supports granular access control, allowing administrators to define specific permissions for each user or service. This ensures that secrets are only accessible by those who need them.

3. Audit Logging and Monitoring

	•	Audit Logs: Vault provides comprehensive audit logging for all password and key management activities. This includes secret generation, access, rotation, and revocation, allowing administrators to monitor and review all actions related to sensitive data.
	•	Anomaly Detection: Luci Digital uses real-time monitoring and anomaly detection to identify any unusual access patterns or suspicious activity related to password and key management. Any anomalies are flagged for investigation and immediate action.

Client Password Management

1. Password Hierarchy

	•	Master Password: Clients configure a master password that secures access to their devices, IoT systems, and services within Luci Digital. This master password is securely stored in Vault, and clients can use it to manage all other passwords in their ecosystem.
	•	Secondary Passwords: Clients can create secondary passwords for individual devices or services, each of which is stored and managed within the client’s password vault. Role-based permissions ensure that only authorized users can access these secondary passwords.

2. User-Focused Security Features

	•	User-Friendly Vault Interface: Clients have access to a user-friendly interface for managing their passwords and credentials. The vault interface is available through both the Luci Digital mobile app and the web portal.
	•	Password Strength Enforcement: Luci Digital enforces password strength requirements for all client accounts and devices, ensuring that passwords meet minimum security standards (e.g., length, complexity, uniqueness).

Conclusion

Luci Digital’s Password and Key Management protocols provide a secure and centralized solution for handling passwords, encryption keys, and other sensitive data. By leveraging Vault for secret management, automatic key rotation, and secure storage, Luci Digital ensures that credentials remain protected against unauthorized access and compromise. With features such as two-factor authentication, role-based access control, and real-time audit logging, the platform delivers a robust security framework that empowers clients to manage their passwords and credentials securely and efficiently.
