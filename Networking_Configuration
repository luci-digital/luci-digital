Luci Digital - Networking Configuration

Overview

The Luci Digital platform employs a secure and dynamic network configuration designed to manage traffic efficiently across its three primary nodes: Nebula, Tron, and Data. At the heart of this setup is Tron, the entry point for all incoming traffic, which routes requests securely to the appropriate nodes. This document provides detailed information on the network architecture, traffic routing, security measures, and key components involved in Luci Digital’s networking configuration.

Core Networking Components

1. Tron (Entry Point)

	•	Role: Tron acts as the entry point for all traffic into the Luci Digital platform. It is responsible for managing external and internal requests, securely routing them to Nebula or Data depending on the service required.
	•	Key Technologies:
	•	Traefik: Dynamic reverse proxy and load balancer, responsible for handling SSL/TLS termination, routing, and load balancing of traffic.
	•	Vault: Used to securely manage and store credentials, API keys, and secrets for all network services.
	•	Security: Tron enforces network segmentation and security policies to ensure that traffic is isolated between internal services and external clients.

2. Nebula (AI and Orchestration)

	•	Role: Nebula handles the orchestration of AI workflows, cloud infrastructure management, and security enforcement. All AI-driven tasks are processed here, and Nebula communicates with Tron for traffic management.
	•	Key Technologies:
	•	Vault: Used to store and manage secrets securely, including credentials for AI models and workflows.
	•	SSL/TLS: Enforces encrypted communication between Tron and Nebula for secure data exchange.

3. Data (Storage and Backup)

	•	Role: Data is responsible for secure storage, backups, and disaster recovery. It ensures data integrity and facilitates the secure storage and retrieval of backups.
	•	Key Technologies:
	•	Proxmox Backup Server: Manages regular backups and disaster recovery processes.
	•	SSL/TLS: Ensures that all communication between Data and the other nodes is encrypted.

Network Architecture

1. Traffic Flow and Routing

	•	Tron serves as the central router for all traffic entering the platform. It manages both external traffic (client requests, service desk requests, etc.) and internal traffic (AI workflows, data backups, etc.).
	•	Traefik is deployed on Tron to dynamically manage routing between nodes based on the type of request. For instance:
	•	Requests related to AI processing are routed to Nebula.
	•	Requests related to data retrieval, backup, or disaster recovery are routed to Data.
	•	Traefik also handles SSL/TLS termination, ensuring that all traffic is encrypted both externally and internally.

2. Network Segmentation

	•	Luci Digital follows a zero-trust network model, ensuring that each node only has access to the specific data and services it requires. Traffic between Nebula, Tron, and Data is isolated to prevent unauthorized access.
	•	Internal traffic between nodes is protected by end-to-end encryption, and only authorized nodes can communicate with one another using secure API keys and tokens managed by Vault.

3. Load Balancing and Scaling

	•	Traefik dynamically manages load balancing across the nodes, ensuring that high traffic volumes are distributed evenly. This ensures that no single node is overwhelmed with requests, improving performance and reliability.
	•	The platform is designed to scale horizontally, meaning that as demand increases, more nodes can be added to the network, with Traefik managing the additional traffic and ensuring seamless operation.

Security Measures

1. SSL/TLS Encryption

	•	All traffic between external clients and the Luci Digital platform is secured using SSL/TLS encryption. Traefik handles SSL certificate management, ensuring that all communications are encrypted end-to-end.
	•	Internal communication between Nebula, Tron, and Data is also encrypted, with certificates managed by Traefik. This prevents any sensitive data from being exposed during transit between nodes.

2. Vault Integration

	•	Vault is used across the entire network for managing secrets, API keys, and credentials. This includes storing encryption keys, SSL/TLS certificates, and access tokens for various services.
	•	Vault ensures that secrets are securely stored and rotated regularly, reducing the risk of credential theft or misuse.

3. Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) and Zero Trust

	•	MFA is enforced for all access to the Luci Digital platform, ensuring that only authorized users can interact with the system. This includes administrators accessing the nodes and clients accessing their services.
	•	Zero Trust Architecture ensures that no part of the network is inherently trusted. Each request and communication is verified before being processed, minimizing the risk of lateral movement in the event of a security breach.

External Connectivity

1. Client Access

	•	Clients access the Luci Digital platform through Tron, which serves as the single entry point. External requests are securely routed via Traefik, and all client communications are encrypted using SSL/TLS.
	•	Client-specific credentials, tokens, and API keys are securely stored in Vault, ensuring that each client’s data remains private and secure.

2. API Access and Tokenization

	•	API requests are routed through Tron and managed by Nebula for service processing. Each API request is authenticated using credentials managed by Vault, ensuring secure access to the platform’s services.
	•	Tokenization is used to manage billing and service usage. Clients are assigned tokens based on their usage, which are securely processed by Nelix on the Tron node.

Backup and Disaster Recovery

1. Encrypted Backups

	•	Data manages regular backups of the entire platform, with all backups being encrypted to ensure data confidentiality. Proxmox Backup Server handles backup schedules, ensuring that both local and cloud backups are maintained.

2. Disaster Recovery Protocols

	•	Data is also responsible for disaster recovery, ensuring that in the event of a system failure, services can be restored quickly and securely. All recovery operations are protected by SSL/TLS encryption and secured by Vault-managed credentials.

Conclusion

Luci Digital’s network configuration is designed for high security, scalability, and efficiency. By leveraging Traefik for dynamic routing, Vault for secure secrets management, and end-to-end encryption, the platform ensures that all communications and data exchanges are protected. The architecture allows for horizontal scaling, providing flexibility as the platform grows, while maintaining a zero-trust environment to prevent unauthorized access.
