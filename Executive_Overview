Executive Overview - Luci Digital Platform

Luci Digital is a holistic tech platform designed to integrate IoT, AI-driven automation, decentralized identity management, and secure networking for businesses, families, and individuals. The platform is built on three key nodes: Nebula, Tron, and Data, each with specific roles in managing AI workflows, secure storage, cloud orchestration, and automated services. Central to this infrastructure is the Lucia AI, an intelligent assistant hosted on Nebula that orchestrates services across all devices and networks.

The system employs advanced security protocols such as multi-factor authentication (MFA), decentralized identity management through the Hedera network, and Vault for secrets management. Additionally, Traefik is used for dynamic reverse proxy and traffic management, ensuring secure communication between all nodes.

Core Components:

	•	Nebula: Hosts Lucia AI, manages security protocols, and orchestrates the system’s AI workflows. It ensures secure communication and handles cloud integration and certificate management.
	•	Tron: Processes AI workflows, handles tokenization, and integrates service desk management through a series of VMs. Tron acts as the entry point for the network, routing traffic securely between nodes.
	•	Data: Responsible for data storage, backup, and disaster recovery. It ensures redundancy and securely stores data processed by the AI and IoT systems.

Networking Configuration

	•	Tron as the Entry Node: All traffic is routed through Tron, which directs requests to either Nebula or Data based on the type of service required. Tron handles both external and internal requests and routes them securely using Traefik as a dynamic reverse proxy.
	•	Secure Communication: Data transmitted between nodes is encrypted end-to-end, with Vault ensuring secure storage of secrets such as API keys, tokens, and credentials.
	•	Redundancy and Backup: Data ensures that all critical information is backed up and recoverable, with failover systems in place for continuity during system outages.
