Executive Overview: Luci Digital Platform

Project Mission:
Luci Digital is designed as a holistic tech platform, focused on providing digital services for small businesses, families, and individuals, while advancing AI, IoT, and decentralized networking technologies. The platform’s goal is to empower users by delivering personalized AI assistance, seamless IoT integration, and secure, scalable services—all with a human touch through the “one human, one AI” philosophy.

Core Technologies and Components:

	1.	Nebula, Tron, and Data: These are the three core VMs running on Proxmox. Nebula will host Lucia AI, the central intelligence of the platform, Tron will handle network security with Traefik, and Data will manage backup and storage solutions. All VMs will have Docker containers running key services.
	2.	Managed Service Engine (with Mobile Device Management): This is the primary tool for managing devices, client services, and system monitoring. It will be deployed within Docker containers across the infrastructure.
	3.	Vagrant and Terraform: These are used to build and deploy the VM and container infrastructure across Nebula, Tron, and Data, ensuring consistency and scalability. Vagrant handles the VM images, while Terraform manages the infrastructure-as-code to automate deployment.
	4.	CloudInit: CloudInit automates VM setup during the boot process, allowing for consistent configuration of VMs, Docker installations, and network settings.
	5.	Spatial.io and Unity SDK: Spatial.io is used to create engaging, avatar-based virtual environments where Lucia AI can interact with users. Unity SDK will be integrated to support these immersive environments, and avatars will evolve to represent Lucia and other AI agents.
	6.	LoRaWAN IoT Network (HiLuciNet): This IoT network will manage various smart devices and sensors for Luci Digital’s users, such as environmental monitoring, tracking, and home automation. Managed via HiLuciNet and integrated through Proxmox and Docker.
	7.	QuickBooks Online API: Integrated into the platform for seamless accounting and bookkeeping, ensuring financial management is automated. Lucia AI will assist with bookkeeping tasks, managing the fiscal year end for Lucy Digital on March 31st, and maintaining compliance with Canadian accounting standards.
	8.	Hedera and Blockchain Integration: Hedera network will be used for decentralized identity verification, ensuring secure client and user identity management. This ties into the reputation token and smart contracts for IoT devices.
