Executive Overview

	•	Purpose: The Luci Digital platform is designed to provide holistic tech services, integrating IoT, smart home systems, AI, blockchain technology, and security management across homes and businesses.
	•	Deployment: The core of the system runs on Synology NAS with DSM, with support for Docker containers, virtual machines, and advanced features like MATTER protocol for device communication.
	•	Components:
	•	MDM Integration: ManageEngine ServiceDesk Plus handles mobile device management, ensuring devices are secure, tokenized, and billed appropriately.
	•	Communication Stack: Client-specific communication channels using Synology Chat, SMS, email, and automated routing ensure efficient management and prioritization of support requests.
	•	Data Security: End-to-end encrypted backups using Synology’s encryption tools and Proxmox Backup Server for scalable, encrypted cloud storage.
	•	Cloud and Remote Device Management: Devices can be added and managed remotely through cloud-based authentication, ensuring continuity even when clients are away from their primary location.
