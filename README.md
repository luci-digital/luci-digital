Executive Overview

The Luci Digital platform is a decentralized, AI-powered tech services system designed to integrate smart home technology, IoT devices, blockchain, and security features into a unified ecosystem. Built on edge computing principles, it supports individuals, businesses, and families with personalized AI, secure communications, and scalable private networks.

Core Components:

	1.	One Person, One AI Model: AI assistants are tied to individuals, providing real-time assistance using edge computing.
	2.	MDM Integration: ManageEngine ServiceDesk Plus handles device management, tokenization, and billing, integrated into the Luci Digital platform.
	3.	Watermarked Communications: All communications, physical and digital, are watermarked with AR-readable identifiers verified on Hedera, providing security and originality.
	4.	IoT Network and HiLuciNet Gateway: The HiLuciNet gateway integrates with The Things Network using LoRaWAN for tracking a variety of IoT metrics, from soil moisture to air quality, with private gateways across Alberta.
	5.	Security and Identity Management: The platform features multi-factor authentication (MFA), zero-trust architecture, and biometric authentication.
	6.	Backup and Disaster Recovery: Synology NAS and Proxmox Backup Server ensure encrypted backups and robust disaster recovery.
	7.	AI and Automation Workflows: AI agents, such as Lucia, manage client services, automation tasks, and network monitoring.
	8.	Surveillance Systems: Integrated surveillance cameras managed through smart boxes provide scalable security solutions.
	9.	AR for Network Visualization: Augmented reality enables users to visualize network connections, packet flow, and device relationships in real time.
