Security Protocols Overview

The Luci Digital platform is built with a focus on security, privacy, and compliance. To ensure the safety of user data and the integrity of the platform, multiple layers of security have been implemented, ranging from network security and identity management to compliance with industry standards such as ISO 27001. This document outlines the protocols, tools, and best practices used to maintain a robust security framework.

Key Security Components:

    Zero Trust Architecture: All network communications are treated as untrusted until verified, minimizing the risk of internal and external threats.
    Biometric Authentication & Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA): Biometric authentication, in combination with MFA, ensures secure access to all systems and services.
    Encryption: End-to-end encryption is used to protect data at rest and in transit, including backups.
    Compliance Standards: Luci Digital follows industry standards such as ISO 27001, SOC 2, and GDPR for data protection and operational security.

Step 1: Zero Trust Architecture

The Luci Digital platform follows a zero trust security model, where no device, user, or network is trusted by default. The architecture enforces strict access controls, continuous validation, and micro-segmentation.

    Network Segmentation: Each component (Nebula, Tron, Data, and IoT devices) operates within its own secure, segmented network. Traffic is tightly controlled and monitored, ensuring that lateral movement between systems is limited.

    Identity Verification: Every user and device must be authenticated before gaining access to any network resource. This includes a combination of:
        Biometric Authentication: Users are authenticated using Face ID, Touch ID, or YubiKey to ensure secure access.
        Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA): Critical systems require MFA, such as SMS or app-based token generation, to secure access to sensitive resources.

    Access Control Lists (ACLs): ACLs are applied to restrict access to network resources based on roles, ensuring that only authorized personnel can access specific systems.

Step 2: Encryption

    Data Encryption at Rest: All sensitive data is encrypted at rest using AES-256 encryption, ensuring that data stored in databases, backups, or on storage devices remains secure even if physical access is compromised.

    Data Encryption in Transit: All data transmitted between clients, servers, and IoT devices is protected using SSL/TLS encryption. This ensures that all communications, whether internal or external, are secure from eavesdropping or man-in-the-middle attacks.

    End-to-End Encryption: For sensitive communications, such as client interactions or secure data transfers, end-to-end encryption is enforced using strong encryption protocols, ensuring that data remains encrypted from sender to receiver.

    SSL/TLS Certificates: All public-facing services, including APIs and web interfaces, use SSL/TLS certificates generated via Let's Encrypt. The platform ensures that certificates are automatically renewed and rotated for continuous security.

Step 3: Identity Management

    Decentralized Identity (DID): Luci Digital integrates Hedera Hashgraph to provide decentralized identity (DID) services, ensuring secure and verifiable identities for users. Each user is assigned a unique DID, which is used for authentication and access management across the platform.

    Hedera Hashgraph Integration: The decentralized identity system leverages the Hedera network for secure verification of user identities and roles. This system is tamper-proof and ensures that identities are managed transparently and securely.

    Role-Based Access Control (RBAC): RBAC is enforced across all systems, ensuring that users are granted the minimum necessary permissions based on their role. This is critical in maintaining the principle of least privilege.

    Proof of Identity: Users undergo rigorous proof of identity checks during account creation, leveraging biometric data and DID verification. These checks ensure that all users are verified, reducing the risk of impersonation or unauthorized access.

Step 4: Compliance with Industry Standards

    ISO 27001 Compliance: The Luci Digital platform adheres to ISO 27001 standards for information security management. This includes implementing strong security controls, conducting regular risk assessments, and ensuring that all data is properly secured.

    SOC 2 Compliance: For service providers, SOC 2 Type II compliance ensures that systems are audited for security, availability, processing integrity, confidentiality, and privacy. Regular audits are conducted to ensure that the platform meets these standards.

    GDPR and Data Privacy: The platform complies with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), ensuring that all data related to EU citizens is handled in accordance with privacy laws. This includes obtaining explicit consent for data collection, providing users with access to their data, and ensuring the right to be forgotten is respected.

Step 5: Monitoring and Incident Response

    Real-Time Monitoring: All network traffic and system logs are monitored in real-time using tools like Prometheus, Grafana, and Loki. These tools provide alerts for any suspicious activities, unusual traffic spikes, or potential security breaches.

    Automated Alerts: If a potential threat is detected, automated alerts are generated and sent to the appropriate teams for immediate investigation. This ensures a rapid response to security incidents.

    Incident Response Plan: Luci Digital has an incident response plan in place, which outlines the steps to be taken in the event of a security breach. This includes identifying the breach, containing it, mitigating any damage, and reporting the incident to the relevant authorities and stakeholders.

    Regular Penetration Testing: The platform undergoes regular penetration testing to identify and address potential vulnerabilities. This proactive approach helps to ensure that security remains robust and up-to-date.

Step 6: Secure Development Lifecycle

    Secure Coding Practices: All code developed for the Luci Digital platform follows secure coding practices to prevent vulnerabilities like SQL injection, cross-site scripting (XSS), and cross-site request forgery (CSRF).

    Regular Code Audits: Regular code audits are performed to ensure that the codebase remains secure. Any identified vulnerabilities are promptly addressed.

    Continuous Security Testing: Automated security testing tools are integrated into the development pipeline, ensuring that all code changes are automatically tested for security issues before deployment.
