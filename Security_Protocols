Luci Digital - Security Protocols

Overview

Luci Digital takes a comprehensive, multi-layered approach to security, ensuring that the platform remains protected against threats while providing a seamless user experience. The security protocols encompass everything from network communication to identity verification, secrets management, and data encryption. This document outlines the core security measures implemented across the Luci Digital platform, with a focus on its Nebula, Tron, and Data nodes.

Core Security Features

1. Zero Trust Architecture

	•	Zero Trust ensures that no part of the network is inherently trusted. Each request, communication, or action is verified before it is processed. This prevents unauthorized access and minimizes the risk of lateral movement in the event of a breach.
	•	Strict Access Control: Each node (Nebula, Tron, and Data) has strictly defined access permissions, and only verified and authenticated requests are processed.

2. Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)

	•	MFA is enforced for both administrators and users across the platform, ensuring that access to the system is protected by multiple authentication factors.
	•	MFA Integration with Hedera’s decentralized identity management ensures that each user’s identity is verified using both traditional methods (passwords, one-time codes) and decentralized verification through blockchain.

3. Decentralized Identity Management (DID)

	•	Hedera DID Integration: Luci Digital utilizes Hedera’s decentralized identity framework to verify user identities and establish trust between clients and services. Decentralized identity management provides an extra layer of security, as credentials are validated via the blockchain and can’t be tampered with.
	•	Proof of Identity: All users, clients, and devices are required to verify their identities using Hedera DID, ensuring that only authorized users can access sensitive data or initiate workflows.

Network Security

1. End-to-End Encryption

	•	SSL/TLS Encryption: All data transmitted between clients, nodes (Nebula, Tron, Data), and external services is encrypted using SSL/TLS protocols. This ensures that all communications are secure, preventing unauthorized interception of sensitive data.
	•	Internal Encryption: All internal communications between the nodes are encrypted as well, protecting sensitive data and ensuring the integrity of the system.

2. Traefik as Reverse Proxy and Load Balancer

	•	Dynamic Routing: Luci Digital uses Traefik as a reverse proxy to manage dynamic routing and SSL termination for both internal and external traffic.
	•	SSL/TLS Certificates: Managed by Traefik, ensuring that each session is encrypted and secure.
	•	Load Balancing: Traefik also manages load balancing across nodes, ensuring that no single node is overwhelmed while maintaining a secure flow of data.

3. Network Segmentation

	•	The network is segmented based on function and access level. External-facing services, such as client-facing APIs, are isolated from internal services that handle sensitive data and operations.
	•	Tron manages the traffic between external clients and the internal nodes. Access between nodes is restricted based on pre-defined security rules and is only permitted through secure, authenticated channels.

Secrets and Credentials Management

1. Vault Integration

	•	HashiCorp Vault is used to securely manage secrets, credentials, API keys, and other sensitive data. Vault provides centralized secret storage with dynamic access policies, ensuring that sensitive data is only accessed by authorized services and users.
	•	Encryption Keys: All encryption keys used for data encryption, SSL/TLS certificates, and communication between nodes are managed securely within Vault. These keys are regularly rotated and updated to maintain security.
	•	API Tokens and Credentials: Vault securely stores API tokens, database credentials, and other sensitive information. All requests to Vault are authenticated using strict access control policies.

2. Secret Rotation

	•	Automatic Secret Rotation: Secrets such as API keys, encryption keys, and tokens are automatically rotated on a regular basis by Vault. This reduces the risk of exposure or misuse in the event of a data breach.

Data Security

1. Encryption at Rest and In Transit

	•	Data Encryption: All sensitive data stored within Luci Digital’s platform is encrypted at rest using industry-standard encryption algorithms such as AES-256.
	•	Backup Encryption: Backups of critical data managed by Proxmox Backup Server are also encrypted, ensuring that data remains secure even in storage. Backup data is encrypted before being transmitted to storage nodes.

2. Backup and Disaster Recovery Security

	•	Secure Backups: All backups are securely stored using encryption, ensuring that sensitive data cannot be accessed without proper authorization.
	•	Disaster Recovery Protocols: The Data node manages disaster recovery protocols, ensuring that backup data can be securely restored in the event of a failure. All recovery operations are protected by SSL/TLS encryption and authenticated through Vault.

Access Control and Authorization

1. Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)

	•	RBAC policies define what each user or service can access within the Luci Digital platform. Roles are assigned based on the principle of least privilege, meaning that users and services only have access to the data and operations necessary to perform their tasks.
	•	Granular Permissions: Permissions are set at a granular level, with each role defining specific access to functions, data, and services across the platform.

2. Device Authorization and Management

	•	IoT Device Security: Each IoT device connected to the platform is authorized via decentralized identity management and secured using certificates and encryption.
	•	Device Monitoring: Each device is continuously monitored for unusual activity, and security policies are automatically enforced in case of unauthorized access attempts.

3. Logging and Monitoring

	•	Real-Time Logging: Security events, access logs, and system activity are monitored in real-time. Any unauthorized access attempts or anomalies are immediately flagged for review.
	•	Alerts: Automated alerts are triggered for potential security threats or unusual behavior, enabling administrators to respond swiftly to potential breaches.

Incident Response

1. Security Incident Response Plan

	•	Luci Digital has a security incident response plan in place to handle any security breaches or incidents. This includes defined procedures for incident detection, containment, and recovery.
	•	Forensic Analysis: Logs and system activity data are reviewed during an incident to determine the scope and cause of the breach. Appropriate actions are taken to contain the threat and secure affected systems.

2. Recovery and Post-Incident Measures

	•	Recovery Procedures: In the event of a security breach, Luci Digital’s Data node manages the recovery process, ensuring that systems are restored from encrypted backups without loss of data integrity.
	•	Post-Incident Review: After recovery, a full review is conducted to analyze the root cause of the breach and implement additional measures to prevent future occurrences.

Conclusion

Luci Digital’s security protocols are designed to provide a robust, multi-layered defense against potential threats. By enforcing zero trust architecture, utilizing MFA and decentralized identity management, and integrating Vault for secret management, the platform ensures that all communications, data, and operations are secure. The combination of network segmentation, encrypted communications, and real-time monitoring allows Luci Digital to maintain a secure and scalable environment for its users and services.
