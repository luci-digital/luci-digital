Luci Digital - Service Desk and Management Protocols

Overview

Luci Digital’s Service Desk and Management Protocols provide a structured and efficient approach to handling client requests, managing incidents, and ensuring service continuity across the platform. The service desk is powered by Lucia AI and integrated with the Tron node, which automates responses to common issues, manages support tickets, and facilitates human intervention when needed. This document outlines the protocols for service desk management, incident handling, ticketing, and support workflows within the Luci Digital platform.

Core Components

1. Lucia AI (AI-Powered Service Desk)

	•	Role: Lucia AI is the driving force behind the automation of the service desk. It processes client requests, performs diagnostics, and automates routine tasks, reducing the need for manual intervention.
	•	Core Functions:
	•	Automated Issue Resolution: Lucia AI handles common support requests, such as restarting devices, resetting passwords, and running diagnostics on connected IoT systems.
	•	Proactive Alerts: Lucia AI monitors the platform for potential issues and triggers alerts before they escalate, allowing for proactive maintenance and incident prevention.
	•	Smart Routing: When an issue requires human attention, Lucia AI routes the ticket to the appropriate support agent with diagnostic information, reducing resolution time.

2. Tron Node (Service Desk and Ticketing Management)

	•	Role: The Tron node manages the flow of service requests, incident reports, and support tickets. It ensures that all issues are tracked, assigned, and resolved in a timely manner while maintaining an organized ticketing system.
	•	Core Functions:
	•	Ticket Creation and Assignment: Tron automatically generates tickets for incoming service requests and assigns them based on priority, severity, and agent availability.
	•	Service Level Agreement (SLA) Enforcement: Tron ensures that all service requests are handled within defined SLAs, triggering escalations when necessary to meet performance benchmarks.
	•	Escalation Protocols: Issues that cannot be resolved by Lucia AI or require immediate attention are escalated to human agents based on predefined escalation protocols.

3. Human Agents

	•	Role: Human agents handle complex issues that cannot be resolved by automation or require specialized knowledge. These agents collaborate with Lucia AI to receive diagnostic information and provide effective solutions.
	•	Core Functions:
	•	Manual Issue Resolution: Human agents handle tickets that involve complex troubleshooting, hardware repairs, or unique client requests.
	•	Expert Support: Agents with specific expertise are assigned to handle issues related to advanced configurations, network infrastructure, or custom deployments.
	•	Client Communication: Agents communicate directly with clients to provide status updates, gather additional information, and ensure a positive support experience.

Service Desk Workflow

1. Automated Ticketing System

	•	Ticket Creation: When a client encounters an issue or submits a request, Tron generates a support ticket. Lucia AI attempts to resolve the issue automatically by analyzing the ticket content and executing predefined workflows.
	•	Issue Categorization: Tickets are categorized based on issue type (e.g., device management, network issues, account management) and assigned a priority level (e.g., low, medium, high, critical).
	•	Automated Resolution: If the issue falls within Lucia AI’s capabilities (e.g., password reset, device reboot), the ticket is resolved automatically, and the client is notified of the resolution.

2. Incident Escalation and Resolution

	•	Incident Detection: Lucia AI continuously monitors the Luci Digital platform for anomalies or failures, such as network outages, hardware malfunctions, or device performance issues. When an incident is detected, a ticket is automatically generated.
	•	Escalation Protocol: If Lucia AI is unable to resolve the issue, the ticket is escalated to a human agent. The escalation process includes providing the agent with diagnostic information gathered by Lucia AI to expedite resolution.
	•	Multi-Tier Support: Issues are escalated through multiple support tiers based on their complexity and severity. Lower-tier agents handle routine issues, while higher-tier agents address more complex or critical incidents.

3. Client Communication and Notifications

	•	Real-Time Notifications: Clients are notified in real-time via email, SMS, or the Luci Digital mobile app when a ticket is created, updated, or resolved. Notifications include status updates and estimated resolution times.
	•	Client Interaction: Clients can interact with the service desk through the Luci Digital mobile app, web portal, or via email. They can track the status of their tickets, provide additional information, and communicate directly with support agents.
	•	Service Desk Portal: Clients have access to a self-service portal where they can view their open and closed tickets, access knowledge base articles, and request new services or support.

Incident Management Protocols

1. Incident Detection and Reporting

	•	Proactive Monitoring: Lucia AI monitors system health, device performance, and network activity to detect potential incidents before they impact clients. Alerts are automatically generated and sent to the service desk for investigation.
	•	Client Incident Reports: Clients can report incidents directly through the mobile app or web portal, triggering the creation of a support ticket in the system. Lucia AI evaluates the report and attempts to resolve the issue automatically.

2. Incident Classification and Prioritization

	•	Severity Levels: Incidents are classified based on severity, with higher-severity incidents (e.g., network outages, data breaches) taking priority over lower-severity issues (e.g., device configuration requests).
	•	Response Time Targets: Each severity level is associated with specific response time targets. Tron ensures that all incidents are addressed within the required timeframes based on predefined SLAs.

3. Incident Resolution Process

	•	Diagnostic Information: Lucia AI gathers diagnostic information (e.g., system logs, device performance metrics) to assist human agents in resolving incidents. This information is included in the support ticket to streamline the resolution process.
	•	Manual Intervention: For incidents that cannot be resolved by AI, human agents take over and work to resolve the issue. Agents may remotely access client devices, adjust network configurations, or collaborate with external vendors if necessary.
	•	Post-Incident Review: Once an incident is resolved, a post-incident review is conducted to assess the cause of the issue, the effectiveness of the resolution, and any steps needed to prevent future occurrences.

Service Level Agreements (SLAs)

1. SLA Enforcement

	•	Response Times: Tron monitors SLA compliance by tracking the time taken to respond to and resolve tickets. Response times are prioritized based on the severity of the incident and the agreed-upon SLA with the client.
	•	Escalations for SLA Breaches: If a ticket is approaching its SLA deadline without resolution, it is automatically escalated to a higher-tier support agent or manager to ensure timely resolution.

2. Client-Specific SLAs

	•	Custom SLAs: Clients with specific service requirements may have custom SLAs in place. These SLAs define tailored response times, resolution times, and escalation protocols to meet the unique needs of each client.

3. Performance Metrics and Reporting

	•	SLA Reporting: Luci Digital provides clients with reports on SLA performance, including response times, resolution times, and ticket history. These reports help clients evaluate service effectiveness and identify areas for improvement.
	•	Performance Reviews: Regular performance reviews are conducted to assess the platform’s adherence to SLAs and to identify opportunities for improving response and resolution times.

Security and Compliance

1. Secure Communication

	•	Encryption: All communications between clients, the service desk, and support agents are encrypted using SSL/TLS protocols. This ensures that sensitive information shared during the support process remains secure.
	•	Identity Verification: Before sensitive actions (e.g., password resets, account modifications) are performed, clients are required to verify their identity using two-factor authentication (2FA) or decentralized identity (DID) protocols.

2. Access Control and Auditing

	•	Role-Based Access Control (RBAC): Access to the service desk system is governed by role-based access policies. Only authorized personnel can access specific tickets, client data, or system configurations.
	•	Audit Logs: All service desk activities, including ticket creation, updates, resolutions, and escalations, are logged and monitored for auditing purposes. This ensures accountability and compliance with regulatory requirements.

3. Incident Response and Recovery

	•	Disaster Recovery Protocols: In the event of a critical incident or system failure, Luci Digital’s disaster recovery protocols ensure that services are restored quickly and that all client data is protected. Tron manages the recovery process and coordinates with human agents to bring services back online as quickly as possible.
	•	Incident Reporting: Major incidents that affect service availability or client data are reported to clients immediately, along with an estimated recovery time and any required action steps.
